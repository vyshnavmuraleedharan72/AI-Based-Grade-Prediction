# AI-Based-Grade-Prediction


# Project Overview

The AI-Based Grade Prediction project aims to predict a studentâ€™s final grade (G3) based on features such as:

* Age

* Study Time

* First Period Grade (G1)

* Second Period Grade (G2)

* Attendance

The project involves training a machine learning model (Decision Tree or Artificial Neural Network) to make accurate predictions and deploying it via a user-friendly web application built with Streamlit.

# Features of the Project

## Model Training:

A Decision Tree model is trained to predict final grades.

The model is evaluated using appropriate metrics (RMSE for regression).

## Feature Importance Analysis:

Insights are generated to identify key contributors to grade prediction.

# Web Application:

Users can input student details to get the predicted grade.

## Data Preprocessing:

Data cleaning and preparation steps include handling missing values, scaling, and feature selection.
